    - title: Innovation Networks and Business-Stealing.
      authors: With Philippe Aghion, Matthew O. Jackson & Abhijit Tagade
      date: May 2022

      abstract: We use the universe of US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data on
        patents and inventors from 1976 to 2017 to look at how inventors
        potential concern for business-stealing affects coauthorship on patents.
        First, we find an inverted-U shape in the fraction of coauthors that an
        inventor has per year who are new as a function number of other
        inventors also working in an inventor’s field. Second, we find that
        after a breakthrough invention, an inventor brings in persistently fewer
        than usual new coauthors. Third, a higher potential concern for business
        stealing—as measured either by the number of others working or the
        average price markups by firms in the area—leads to a higher drop in the
        fraction of new co-authors per patent after a breakthrough. We show how
        these patterns can be explained via a simple model in which inventors
        trade off gains from collaboration against threats of business stealing.

    - title: A State-Space Model to Estimate Potential Growth in the Industrialized
        Countries.
      authors: With Thomas Brand and Gilles Dufrénot
      journal: Recent Econometric Techniques for Macroeconomic and Financial Data
      year: "2021"
      url: "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54252-8_3 "
      abstract: This paper proposes new estimates of potential growth for 5 major
        industrialized countries. We use a state-space approach to obtain joint
        estimates of potential growth and the natural interest rates. The model
        is a reduced-form of a partial equilibrium model with a Phillips curve
        and an IS curve. In addition to the usual determinants of prices and
        business fluctuations, we consider financial variables as a determinant
        of the business cycle.
