      abstract: We use the universe of US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data on
        patents and inventors from 1976 to 2017 to look at how inventors
        potential concern for business-stealing affects coauthorship on patents.
        First, we find an inverted-U shape in the fraction of coauthors that an
        inventor has per year who are new as a function number of other
        inventors also working in an inventor’s field. Second, we find that
        after a breakthrough invention, an inventor brings in persistently fewer
        than usual new coauthors. Third, a higher potential concern for business
        stealing—as measured either by the number of others working or the
        average price markups by firms in the area—leads to a higher drop in the
        fraction of new co-authors per patent after a breakthrough. We show how
        these patterns can be explained via a simple model in which inventors
        trade off gains from collaboration against threats of business stealing.

    - title: A State-Space Model to Estimate Potential Growth in the Industrialized
        Countries.
      authors: With Thomas Brand and Gilles Dufrénot
      journal: Recent Econometric Techniques for Macroeconomic and Financial Data

      abstract: This paper proposes new estimates of potential growth for 5 major
        industrialized countries. We use a state-space approach to obtain joint
        estimates of potential growth and the natural interest rates. The model
        is a reduced-form of a partial equilibrium model with a Phillips curve
        and an IS curve. In addition to the usual determinants of prices and
        business fluctuations, we consider financial variables as a determinant
        of the business cycle.

    - title: Chinese Patenting and U.S. Firms Technology Specialization.
      year: 2023
      abstract: "We investigate the impact of Chinese competition on the innovation
        strategies of U.S. firms. We study this effect in light of the surge in
        Chinese patenting following its entry into the World Trade Organization
        (WTO). With data on patent applications into the USPTO, we first document
        the exponential growth in applications from Chinese assignees. Our
        findings illustrate that despite being heterogeneous, this increase
        pervades all technological fields. Prior to China's WTO entry, we recorded
        few applications from Chinese assignees; however, the following two
        decades witnessed exponential growth.  Next, we leverage this foreign
        competition shock and the variations in firms' exposure to apply a
        shift-share instrumental variable design using international applications
        from China as an instrument. Our findings indicate that affected U.S.
        firms concentrate on fewer technologies and produce less original patents.
        We find no evidence that these effects are offset by an overall
        improvement in patent quality. On the contrary, we measure a decline in
        breakthrough patents, despite a surge in the number of inventors and
        patent applications. We interpret these results as a shift in the
        innovation strategy of incumbent U.S. firms towards more incremental
        innovation."
