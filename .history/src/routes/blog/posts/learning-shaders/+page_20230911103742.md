For a couple of years now, I've been fascinated by shaders. However, each time I tried to learn, it was not even like learning a new language, it was like learning how to read and write. I was completely lost.
When I decided to port this personal website to [Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev/), I wanted to recreate the little animation I had on the home page, but using shaders instead of CSS. Initially, the CSS animation was a simple `border-radius` animation that looked like this:

<div class = "py-one">
<CssBlob/>
</div>

Why would I do that you may ask? For fun, and because it seems simple enough to not be discouraged. And now that I have time after defending my PhD, I can finally do it. So here is my journey into shaders.

> For a in-depth introduction to shaders, I cannot recommend enough [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)

## Shaders: the good, the bad and the ugly

You may already know shaders from video games, where they are used to improve [lighting](https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/normal-mapping.html) create [special effects](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-fog.html), create [cartoonish effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading) — hence the 'shade' in 'cell shading' — etc. In fact, shaders is probably what makes video games look so good nowadays when compared to the games of the 90s. But what is a shader exactly?

A minimal definition of a shader would be "a small program, running on the GPU, that takes — at least — a pixel coordinate as input and outputs a color". The reason why they are so popular in video games and computer graphics is that they are *extremly* efficient. Their performance is not because they run on the GPU, but because they are highly parallelized (which can, in turn, be exploited by modern GPUs). Intuitively, a shader is a program that will be executed for each pixel on the screen *simultaneously*.

[INSERT ILLUSTRATION, NVIDIA feat Mythbusters one?]

> Note that there are multiple flavors of shading languages, and I will focus on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) one, which has the advantage of being supported in the browser!

This incredible power comes, however, at some costs: shaders needs to be *small* and *low-level*, which means that you cannot rely on high-level abstraction, and you cannot include external libraries to make your life easier (\* laugh in javascript \*). Finally, because they are parallelized by nature, shaders are *memoryless* and *stateless*, which means that you cannot store information between two executions of the shader, and you cannot access information from other pixels. Taken together, these constraints make shaders particularly hard to learn (especially if, like me, you only used high-level languages before).

## Coordinate is all you need

The shader takes pixel coordinates and outputs a color encoded in [RGBA](#TODO) where each channel is ranging from 0 (no signal) to 1 (full lit) (It is also possible to process [vertex positions](https://shader-tutorial.dev/basics/vertex-shader/), but this topic is left as an exercise to the reader). Coordinates are often normalized between 0 and 1, where (0, 0) is the lower left corner of the screen and (1, 1) is the upper right corner (called [`st`, or `uv`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10568390/difference-between-uv-and-st-texture-coordinates) by convention).
Now, let's imagine you want to write the simplest shader: a gradient where the red component increases from left to right and the green component increases from bottom to top. That is, find the function f(x,y) in the following illustration:
[#TODO: Explain UV space]

<FragmentShaderSVG/>

Yeah, sure, it may seem too simple, but it's a great opportunity to get familiar with the syntax of shaders. Now take a look at the implementation below and try to modify it to change the gradient (say from black to blue).

<details>
    <summary>Hint</summary>
    Replace line 10 by 
    <code>gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, st.x, 1.0);</code>
</details>

<Shader fragmentShader={FirstFrag} vertexShader={vertexShader} editor={true} legend="A shader. Impressive?"/>

There are a few interesting things to note here about the syntax:
- We can declare input to the shaders that can be *varying* or *uniform*. Varying variables are different for each pixel, while uniform variables are the same for all pixels. Here, we declare a varying variable `vUv`, which is a 2D vector representing the position of the pixel on a plane. It is declared as `varying` because the value is different for each pixel on the screen.
[#TODO: explain where does the value of vUv come from]
- The lower left corner is the origin of the UV space, contrary to the default convention in svg or html canvas.
- All variables are typed like in C, and multiple types are available to represent vectors and matrices (e.g. `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `mat2`, `mat3`, etc).
- Vector elements are accessed using the dot notation (e.g. `vec2(1, 2).x` is 1), you can also access sub-vectors using the `xy` notation (e.g. `vec4(1, 2, 3, 4).xy` is `vec2(1, 2)`).
- There is no `return` statement, the color of the pixel is the value taken by the variable `gl_FragColor` in the `main()` function.

Although trivial, you can already feel the power of shaders. Without the parallelization, an equivalent result would have required a loop over all the pixels of the canvas — 90000 in this case — for a dumb gradient. But we can do much more than that.

## One step() beyond

Now, to reproduce my original animation, I need to draw shapes with salient edges. While this may seem trivial, it is not. In a shader, you can't draw elementary shapes, more precisely, you can't **draw** anything. So how to you do? With math and trigonometry!

To represent a disk, you can compute the distance of the pixel to the center of the disk, and output a color that depends on this distance. This could be computed with basic trigonometry, however, we also have a built-in function for that: `distance(vec2 p1, vec2 p2)`. If you map this distance to the color of the pixel, you will get a circular gradient. To make it look like a proper disk, you need to apply the `step(float threshold, float value)` function, which returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the input is below or above a given threshold.

There are a lot of smooth max, or smooth min, in the wild. You may have encountered the log(exp(x) + exp(y)) function, which is a smooth max.

<Shader fragmentShader={SimpleSDF} vertexShader={vertexShader}
    slider=true sliderDefaultValue={0} sliderMin={0} sliderMax={1} sliderStep={0.01}
    u_time={uniforms.time.value}
    sliderTitle="Slide to the right to apply the step() function"
    sliderMarkers={['<distance()', 'step()>']}
    editor={true}
    legend="Distance from (0.5,0.5)"/>

> Have you noticed the aliasing around the disk? This is because the step function is too abrupt. To solve this, GLSL provides a `smoothstep(float t_start, float t_end , float x)` function, which will give you... a smooth step!

This way of using distances to generate shapes is the workhorse of many of the cool shaders you may encounter on the internet. So let's dive a bit deeper into this.

## Signed Distance Functions (SDF)

You may think that drawing shapes involves joining points in space, and you're not wrong. But there are other ways. As you just saw, a circle can be defined through it's distance to point in spaces. Points that are at the same distance (that are *isodistant*) to the center of the circle are on the circle. This way of defining shapes is called a *Signed Distance Function* (SDF). It is called *signed* because the distance can be negative if the point is inside the shape.

So the first thing we need is to define a function that computes the distance of any point in the space to a circle. As always, it's better to start simple, so let's begin by finding the distance to the origin. In the illustration below, it is easy to see that the distance between the origin and the center of the circle `C` is the distance between the origin and the circle plus the radius of the circle `r`.

<SDFIllustration/>

We can thus define a function that gives us the SDF of a circle of radius `r` at a point `p` as:

```
float circleSDF(vec2 p, float r) {
    return length(p) - r;
}
```

> Note that you can either think of the above function as the distance from the origin to the circle, or the distance of a point `p` to a circle centered at the origin. Both are equivalent.

In application however, we want the distance to _any_ point in the UV space, not just to the origin. To fix that, we can simply translate the point `p` by the position of the pixel `st`. For pixels lying within the circle, the distance is negative, and for pixels outside the circle, the distance is positive. These two regions are separated by the circle, which is the region for wich the distance is zero. Drawing a disk is then as simple as applying the `1. - step()` function to the distance, that is, setting the value to 1 if the distance is negative (*i.e* within the circle), and 0 otherwise.

<Shader fragmentShader={SDF} vertexShader={vertexShader}
    slider=true sliderDefaultValue={0.2} sliderMin={0} sliderMax={0.5} sliderStep={0.01}
    u_time={uniforms.time.value}
    sliderTitle="Slide to the right to change the radius of the circle"
    sliderMarkers={['0', '0.5']}
    editor={true}

In this article, I will not cover other shapes that you can create with SDF, but you can look at this [great article](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/) by Inigo Quilez to learn more. Instead, I will look at how we can combine these shapes to create our blob.

<!-- Fun title on combining, with a ref -->
## One and one makes another one

SDFs has some interesting properties, one of them is that it is especially easy to create new shapes with [boolean operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Diagrammatic_representations). To have the union of the two SDFs, you need to take the minimum of the two distances. For pixels that are in either of the two shapes (or in both), the min() will output a negative distance, and for pixels that are outside both shapes, the min() will output a positive distance. We end up with a new SDF that is negative inside the union of the two shapes, and positive outside. In the exemple below, I start by showing the two SDFs, one in red and on in green. With the slider, you can see the result of the union of the two shapes using the min() function.

<Shader fragmentShader={CombiningFrag} vertexShader={vertexShader}
    editor={true}
    slider=true sliderDefaultValue={0} sliderMin={0} sliderMax={1}
    sliderStep={0.01} sliderTitle="Slide to apply min() of the two SDFs"
    sliderMarkers={["<Unblended", "Blended>"]}
    legend={'min(a,b) => a∨b'}/>


> Have you noticed that I used `1.-smoothstep()`? This is because `step()` (and `smoothstep()`) outputs 1 when the distance is **above** the threshold (*i.e* outside the disk). To get a positive value **inside** the shape, we need to invert the output.

Complex shapes — like a blob! — are thus the combination of many simple SDFs. Like legos, you have many simple SDFs (building blocks) that can be combined to any shape you want. However, a blob is smooth and jelly-like, unlike the sharp angle at the junction of our two disks. Luckily, SDFs have one last magic property for us.

## Smooth operator
To create an appealing effect, we would like the shapes to blend smoothly together like in a lava lamp. Instead of computing the minimum of the two SDFs as in the previous example, we want a function that outputs a  


<Shader fragmentShader={BlendFrag} vertexShader={vertexShader}
    slider={true} sliderDefaultValue={0} sliderMin={0} sliderMax={1}
    sliderStep={0.01} sliderTitle="Slide to increase the smoothing factor"
    sliderMarkers={null}
    legend="Satisfying blending"/>

## An animated blob

We can pass any uniform to our shader, including the time. This way, we can animate our blob by moving the circles around. With a
few more circles, we can get something that looks like a blob.

<Shader fragmentShader={Blob01Frag} vertexShader={vertexShader}
    legend="It's a blob!"
    u_time={uniforms.time.value}
    slider={true} sliderDefaultValue={0.9} sliderMin={0.85} sliderMax={.99}
    sliderStep={0.001} sliderTitle="Adjust the size of the metaballs"
    sliderMarkers={null}/>
<!--
## Appendix

We finally got our blob, but it's a bit boring in black and white. It's time to make it juicy. My goal is to add a gradient like in the original animation.

<Canvas size={{height: uniforms.resolution.value.y, width: uniforms.resolution.value.x}}>
    <SimpleShader
        uniforms={uniforms}
        fragmentShader={ditherFrag}
        vertexShader={vertexShader} />
</Canvas>


## Putting it all together

<div id="captureMouse" on:mousemove={handleMouseMove}>
<Canvas size={{height: uniforms.resolution.value.y, width: uniforms.resolution.value.x}}>
{#key finalFrag}
    <SimpleShader
        uniforms={uniforms}
        fragmentShader={finalFrag}
        vertexShader={vertexShader} />
{/key}
</Canvas>

<span id = "anchor">anchor</span>

</div>
